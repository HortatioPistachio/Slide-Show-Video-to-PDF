program sorta works for some tests

this program is designed ot take a slide show presentation and convert those slides to a pdf format
for easy viewing. 
Motivation is that half the time the lectures dont release the slides with the lectures and I dont wanna
rewatch an hour long lecture just to find the 1 slide I need to understand stuff

cannot use wsl, due to no graphical capability
use power shell instead

things to improve:
    betterslide regognition and ways to tests
    convert outputed images to pdf
    increase speed
    add parrallel proccesing
    be able to recognise when a video is being played and skip over it/ make 1 side with message
    intergrate into web app
