currently program does not work

this program is designed ot take a slide show presentation and convert those slides to a pdf format
for easy viewing. 
Motivation is that half the time the lectures dont release the slides with the lectures and I dont wanna
rewatch an hour long lecture just to find the 1 slide I need to understand stuff

cannot use wsl, due to no graphical capability
use power shell instead
